                    <h3>Reference Material</h3>
                    <p>The first step in my design process involves brainstorming ideas, researching, and conceptualizing the project.</p>
                    <p>When looking for references I first looked at a lot of websites for inspiration so I can help design the wireframes for my website but as I continued to design my website, I realized that I needed to design my website to align with my target audience and the purpose of my website. Therefore, I had to revisit references of portfolio websites that have similar goals as mine so I can see how they represent their content appropriately.</p>

                    <p>The main website I used for inspiration was the one by Rafael.</p>
                    <p>I found her home page and the consistent navigation menu on each page a good way to allow users to intuitively explore different sections. A consistent navigation menu is key to a user-friendly experience because it helps visitors orient themselves no matter where they are on the site. It's great for keeping the design unified and makes sure users can always find their way to important sections without unnecessary clicks or confusion. Varona's use of a prominent homepage and a persistent navigation menu likely serves to engage visitors right from the start, providing a snapshot of her skills and offerings while ensuring they can easily search deeper into the content. This setup respects the users' time by streamlining their navigation experience and aligns with web design best practices for accessibility and user experience. Other websites I used as inspiration also used a similar navigation technique.</p>

                    <h2 >Style Guide</h2>
                    <p><strong>Statement:</strong> My website showcases a modern, minimalist aesthetic that highlights my expertise in interactive media and game design, ensuring a user-friendly and engaging experience for every visitor.</p>
                    <h3>Defining Visual Aesthetic</h3>
                    <p>The aesthetic of the website aims to be modern, minimalist, and user-friendly. It seeks to create an engaging and interactive experience that showcases creativity through simplicity. The design focuses on showcasing interactive media and game design work, which means it should be visually appealing yet not overwhelming, allowing the work itself to stand out.</p>
                    <p>This aesthetic complements the content by not overshadowing the showcased work. A minimalist design ensures that the portfolio pieces, blogs, and essays are the focal points. This approach also aligns with the usability principles, ensuring that the website is accessible and easy to navigate.</p>
                    <h4>Color Scheme</h4>
                    <p>A clean and modern aesthetic, leading to the selection of a neutral color palette with one or two accent colors for emphasis (e.g., a vibrant blue or green).</p>
                    <p>Neutral backgrounds provide a clean canvas that makes content stand out, enhancing readability and user focus. The choice of a vibrant accent color is to draw attention to key interactive elements like calls to action, links, and buttons. This strategy uses color psychology to guide user behavior while maintaining a professional and uncluttered appearance. The neutral backdrop focuses attention on the content, while the color accents guide the user to interactive elements. This approach also aligns with visual accessibility standards.</p>

                        <summary>Alignment with Goal</summary>
                        <p>The mix of a subdued blue, a soft peach, a dark sea green, and a muted green suggests a fresh, current vibe that doesn't overpower the user. It's sophisticated and could be great for highlighting design work without competing with it. These colours can be used for interface elements to subtly direct attention and provide a sense of calm and balance.</p>
                        <p>The neutral palette offers earthy tones, cool grey, light grey, and almost black, implying a grounded, classic look that's often associated with simplicity and elegance. This could be particularly effective in sections that are text-heavy or where I want users to focus on content rather than design, such as blog or essay pages.</p>
                        <p>I need to remember that colour can carry different meanings and invoke various emotions. My palette has been carefully curated to resonate with the siteâ€™s ethos and enhance user experience. The subdued blue sets the professional tone for my portfolio sections, offering a calming backdrop that underscores trust and focuses attention on the content. Soft peach introduces a warm, friendly energy, perfect for call-to-action buttonsâ€”encouraging interaction without being overbearing. The use of dark sea green in interactive elements signifies growth and harmony, inviting users to engage confidently with forms and tabs.</p>
                        <p>The muted green provides a creative spark across sidebars and secondary information, creating a space where innovation is both highlighted and appreciated. For the textual haven of blogs and essays, earthy tones ground the reader in stability, making lengthy reads more comfortable and less visually taxing. The cool grey underpins commitment to a modern, balanced interface, serving as the foundation for metadata and auxiliary details, while light grey offers a restful canvas that allows for user content to truly stand out.</p>
                        <p>Finally, almost black conveys a definitive strength, anchoring the siteâ€™s text with undeniable clarity and sophisticationâ€”ensuring legibility and focus where it matters most.</p>
                        <p>As I refine my style guide, I will consider the legibility of text over these colours, ensuring there is sufficient contrast, particularly for those with visual impairments. Tools like the WebAIM (Web Accessibility In Mind) Contrast Checker can help me ensure that the text is readable against the chosen background colours.</p>
                    </details>
                    <h4>Layout</h4>
                    <p>A structured layout with a focus on simplicity and content prioritization, utilizing a combination of grid-based arrangements for sections and flexible containers that ensure responsiveness.</p>
                    <p>To maintain visual harmony and ensure content readability, I use gutters of 30 pixels between columns in my grid layout. This spacing allows for clear separation between different elements, helping to delineate sections distinctly without crowding. The vertical spacing between sections is set at 50 pixels. This spacing provides a comfortable visual break for the user, which is crucial for long pages such as essays and detailed design explanations, facilitating easier content digestion and reducing visual fatigue. Margins around the content are dynamically set at 5% of the screen width on larger screens and increase to 10% on smaller screens to ensure content does not feel cramped, especially on mobile devices where space is at a premium.</p>
                    <p>On my About page, I place a significant image front and center, establishing a personal connection with visitors right away. Directly below the image, I provide a narrative that encapsulates my professional background and ethos. This natural visual-to-text flow guides visitors from a personal introduction to deeper engagement. At the end of this narrative journey, a strategically positioned contact button invites collaboration, acting as a clear call-to-action.</p>
                    <p>My Blog Index employs a card layout to present posts succinctly. Each card combines a compelling image with a snapshot of content, balancing visual interest with quick insights. This layout honors the visitorâ€™s need for efficiency, allowing for a swift preview of topics without delving into full articles. Navigational aids like breadcrumb links are thoughtfully integrated, offering effortless traversal through the content landscape.</p>
                    <p>In each Individual Blog Post, I prioritize a storytelling format with a captivating title and opening image that draws readers into the article. The body of the post is framed with generous whitespace, optimizing the reading experience for focus and comfort. Navigational elements are both above and below the post, making it easy for readers to orient themselves and continue their journey through my writings.</p>
                    <p>My Portfolio page showcases projects in an uncluttered grid, emphasizing the work without distractions. Interactive hover states not only add a layer of engagement but also serve as a prompt for more detailed exploration upon interaction. This design is meticulously crafted to put my work in the spotlight, enabling visitors to navigate my portfolio intuitively, and identify the projects that resonate with them.</p>
                    <p>A minimalist design ensures that portfolio pieces, blogs, and essays are the focal points, enhancing readability and user focus. This approach aligns with usability principles, ensuring the website is accessible and easy to navigate.</p>
                    <h4>Font Choices</h4>
                    <p>My typographic choices are a blend of aesthetics and functionality, designed to facilitate effortless reading and elevate the user experience. For headings and user interface elements, I've chosen Roboto, a sans-serif font known for its geometric forms and friendly curves, providing a modern and approachable feel. I will use a weight of 700 for headings, making them distinct and assertive on both desktop and mobile displays.</p>
                    <p>Body text is rendered in Merriweather, a serif font that excels in readability. With its large x-height and slightly condensed letterforms, it's designed to be legible on any screen, thus minimizing eye strain during prolonged reading sessions. The body text is set at a weight of 400, offering an optimal balance of legibility and elegance on various devices.</p>
                    <p>For captions and less prominent text, utilize a lighter weight of Roboto, ensuring that auxiliary information does not compete with the primary content for attention, yet remains perfectly legible.</p>

                        <li><strong>Navigation Bar (main and side):</strong> 
                            <p>This persistent element at the top of each page allows users to easily navigate across the website without losing their place. It's designed to be minimalistic and clean, ensuring it complements rather than competes with the content. The right-aligned layout respects the Western reading pattern, ending in actionable items like 'Contact' or 'Blog', which encourage further user engagement.</li>
                        While the side menu bar will be a button that expands into a list with all the title on it, wil also be stick. Usefull for blogs and essay which have muliple entries.
                            </p>
                        <li><strong>Buttons:</strong> <P>
                            Buttons are used throughout the site to direct user actions, including submitting forms, starting projects, and reading more about a specific topic. They are styled with rounded corners and a color that stands out against the background, drawing attention while maintaining an aesthetic coherence with the overall design. The hover state introduces a subtle animation that changes the button's color and elevation, providing visual feedback that the button is clickable. Some include Back to top, next, previous, read more.</li>
                        </P>
                        <li><strong>Input Fields:</strong> <p>
                            Input fields are essential for interactive forms on the 'Contact' page and in the blog comments section, facilitating user engagement through submissions.</li>

                        </p>
                        <li><strong>Breadcrumb Navigation:</strong><p>
                             Breadcrumbs provide a pathway for users to trace back their navigation route and explore sections of the site at a higher hierarchy without having to repeatedly use the back button. Placed subtly at the top of content-rich pages, like blog posts or project details, breadcrumbs are small, clickable links that complement the main navigation by offering a textual understanding of the user's location within the site.</li>
                        </p>
                        <li><strong>Hover Effects:</strong><p> 
                            Hover effects on links, buttons, and images give users feedback that an element is interactive, which is crucial for understanding possible actions on a page. The effects include color changes, underlining for text links, and scale transformations for images, all of which enhance the interactive experience without distracting from the content.</li>
                        </p><li><strong>Scrolling:</strong> <p>
                            In my design and essay pages, I have implemented a dynamic table of contents (ToC) to streamline the user experience and facilitate easy access to information. This ToC features all the main headings on the page, each linked directly to their respective sections. The ToC provides users with an immediate overview of the content available on the page, allowing them to gauge the scope and depth of the material at a glance. By clicking on any heading in the ToC, users are taken directly to that section, saving time and effort in scrolling through potentially lengthy pages. This is especially beneficial for users seeking specific information who may be in a hurry.</li>
                        </p><li><strong>Sticky Navigation:</strong>  <P>
                            </p> users scroll down the page, the ToC remains visible and fixed on the side of the screen (or at the top on smaller devices). This â€˜stickyâ€™ feature ensures that the navigation tool is always accessible, no matter where the user is on the page. The ToC actively highlights which section is currently being viewed, giving users a real-time indication of their location within the document. This not only improves the readability by breaking the content into digestible sections but also keeps users oriented as they delve deeper into the text.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> These elements enhance the interactive experience without distracting from the content. They improve usability by providing clear pathways for navigation and interaction, supporting a seamless user experience.</p>
                    <h4>Composition</h4>
                    <p>Use visual hierarchy to guide the user's journey through the website, employing size, color, and layout to emphasize important content. Aim for a balance that supports user engagement without distraction, using thoughtful asymmetry to keep the design interesting. Ensure harmony by consistently applying my design choices across all pages.</p>
                    
         
               
                    <h4>Consistency and Navigation</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Main Navigation Menu</li>

<h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
<details>
    <summary>How it all comes together</summary>
    <p>The UI and UX design choices of my website profoundly impact the organization and functionality of the code, ensuring it remains user-friendly and accessible. The folder structure of my website is carefully organized to reflect the hierarchical information structure, with separate folders for blogs, essays, portfolio, and design, each containing its own index.html and individual content pages. This organization ensures that content is logically separated, making it easier for users to navigate and for developers to manage.</p>
    <p> Separating content into distinct folders aligns with best practices for content management and organization. It makes the site easier to maintain and update, ensuring that each section can be developed independently without affecting other parts of the site. This structure also facilitates better scalability as new content can be added without disrupting the existing organization.</p>
    <p>This separation of concerns is further extended into distinct folders for CSS and JavaScript, promoting modularity and scalability. For example, the styles.css file houses all styling rules, ensuring consistency across all pages, while separate JavaScript files (main.js, menu.js, blogs.js, backToTop.js) manage different functionalities, making the website easier to maintain and update.</p>
    <p> By separating CSS and JavaScript into their own files, we ensure that styling and functionality are modular and reusable. This modularity allows for easier debugging and updates since changes in one part of the site won't inadvertently affect other parts. This structure supports the principle of separation of concerns, which is fundamental for scalable and maintainable web development.</p>
    <p>Semantic markup is a key component of the website, providing clear context to browsers and assistive technologies. The use of tags like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> enhances accessibility and ensures that interface elements, such as navigation bars, buttons, and forms, are fully and correctly expressed.</p>
    <p>Semantic tags improve the readability of the HTML for developers and assistive technologies, enhancing accessibility for users with disabilities. They provide a clear structure to the content, which helps screen readers interpret and navigate the site more effectively. Additionally, search engines use semantic tags to better understand and index the content, improving SEO.</p>
    <p>For instance, the navigation bar uses semantic <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> tags and ARIA attributes to improve usability for screen readers.</p>
    <p> The <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> tag explicitly defines the navigation section of the page, while ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes provide additional context for screen readers, ensuring that navigation elements are accessible to all users, including those who rely on assistive technologies.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is used extensively to handle various interaction points, such as menu toggles, breadcrumbs, scrolling, back-to-top functionality, and dynamic blog menu generation. Event listeners are registered within the DOMContentLoaded event listener to ensure the scripts execute only after the HTML has been fully loaded, enhancing performance and user experience.</p>
    <p> Registering event listeners within the DOMContentLoaded event listener ensures that the scripts only run after the page content is fully loaded, preventing errors that might occur if the scripts try to manipulate elements that are not yet available. This approach improves the performance and reliability of the website.</p>
    <p>Key functionalities, such as form submissions, are handled using the Formspree API. By connecting my contact form to the Formspree service, I ensured that user inquiries are efficiently processed and delivered to my email, providing a seamless and reliable communication channel.</p>
    <p> Using Formspree for form submissions offloads the server-side processing, reducing the complexity of the backend and ensuring that form submissions are handled securely and reliably. This approach improves user experience by providing a quick and efficient way to contact me without requiring extensive server-side infrastructure.</p>
    <p>Interaction points and functionalities are consolidated where possible to avoid repetition and improve maintainability. For instance, common functionalities like menu toggles are handled in menu.js, while scrolling effects are managed in scrolling.js.</p>
    <p> Consolidating common functionalities into separate files reduces code duplication and makes the codebase easier to manage. This approach adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, which promotes reusability and maintainability in software development.</p>
    <p>CSS is used extensively to ensure consistent styling across all pages, avoiding inline styles to maintain a modular approach. The use of media queries ensures responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, enhancing the user experience.</p>
    <p>External CSS files enable consistent styling across the entire site, making it easier to implement and maintain a cohesive design. Media queries allow the design to be responsive, ensuring that the site looks and functions well on various devices, from desktops to smartphones. This responsiveness is crucial for providing a good user experience across different screen sizes.</p>
    <p>Reusable classes and CSS variables are utilized to maintain consistency and efficiency. This approach reduces redundancy and ensures that changes can be made swiftly across the entire website. For example, common elements like buttons, headings, and containers have their styles defined once and applied across all relevant pages.</p>
    <p>Using reusable classes and CSS variables promotes a clean and efficient CSS structure. It reduces redundancy and ensures that any changes to the styling need to be made in only one place, making the site easier to update and maintain. This approach aligns with best practices for maintainable and scalable CSS design.</p>
    <p>Performance Optimization
    One significant aspect of the development process was optimizing performance by using the defer attribute in script tags. The defer attribute allows scripts to be downloaded in parallel with the rest of the page and executed only after the HTML has been completely parsed.</p>
    <p> Using the defer attribute improves page load times by ensuring that scripts do not block the rendering of the page. This approach enhances the user experience by allowing the content to load faster, making the site more responsive and interactive. It also contributes to better performance metrics, which are important for SEO and user satisfaction.</p>
