                <h3>Folder structure and URL scheme</h3>
                <p class="intro"> I envision a blog page designed with a visually appealing timeline layout, featuring blocks representing individual blog posts. Each block displays the date and title of the post, along with a ‘’check it out’’ button for users to explore further. Clicking on this button navigates users to a dedicated page where they can access the complete content of the blog post. This same concept applies to the portfolio and essay pages. Therefore, I've carefully considered the folder structure as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>index.html</code>: Home page.</li>
                    <li>Blog Folder:
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>index.html</code>: Blog page with the timeline layout.</li>
                            <li><code>post1.html</code>: Page for the first blog post.</li>
                            <li><code>post2.html</code>: Page for the second blog post.</li>
                            <li>(Additional HTML files for more posts)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Works folder:
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>index.html</code>: Works/portfolio page.</li>
                            <li><code>work1.html</code>: Page for the first work/portfolio item.</li>
                            <li><code>work2.html</code>: Page for the second work/portfolio item.</li>
                            <li>(Additional HTML files for more works/items)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Essays folder:
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>index.html</code>: Essays page.</li>
                            <li><code>essay1.html</code>: Page for the first essay.</li>
                            <li><code>essay2.html</code>: Page for the second essay.</li>
                            <li>(Additional HTML files for more essays)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Images folder:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Directory for storing images used across the site.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>CSS Folder: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Directory for storing CSS stylesheets.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><code>about.html</code>: About page.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Outline of Decision Making</h3>
                <p><strong>Scalability:</strong> This approach by creating separate HTML files for each blog post, work/portfolio item, and essay allows for seamless addition of new content by simply creating new HTML files and placing them in the corresponding directories. It can accommodate future expansion and addition of content without requiring significant restructuring.</p>
                <p><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Separating CSS folder to control the visual presentation of the website while keeping the HTML structure clean and focused on content organization enables easier maintenance and future updates.</p>
                <p><strong>Clarity and Organization:</strong> Each main section of the website (home, blog, works, essays, about) gets its own directory to contain related files. This separation helps maintain clarity and prevents clutter.</p>

                <h3>Reflection on  <cite>Moulthrop's</cite> Work:</h3>
                <p>  <cite>Moulthrop's</cite> exploration of hypertext's democratizing potential resonates strongly with online censorship, digital privacy, and platform monopolies. For example, his emphasis on the decentralization of control shows concerns about the dominance of tech giants like Google and Facebook, which have significant influence over online discourse and content distribution. Moulthrop's insights for user-generated content and participatory culture reflects ongoing discussions about the democratization of media production and the rise of citizen journalism in the age of social media.
                    To enrich my understanding of  <cite>Moulthrop's</cite> work, it's essential to consider critiques and alternative perspectives from scholars who have engaged with his ideas:
                    </p>
                    <h4><cite>Wendy Chun's</cite> Concept of "Control and Freedom"</h4>
                    <p> <cite>Wendy Chun</cite>, a Professor of Modern Culture and Media at Brown University, interrogates the relationship between control and freedom in digital media environments. Her work challenges the conventional understanding of hypertext by drawing attention to the power dynamics essential in online spaces.
                        <cite>Chun </cite> argues that while hypertext promises freedom through its non-linear, decentralized structure, it also operates within systems of control and surveillance. Online platforms collect vast amounts of data about users' interactions, preferences, and behaviors, exerting control over their digital experiences. Moreover, algorithms shape the visibility and accessibility of content, influencing users' choices and limiting their freedom to navigate online spaces autonomously.
                        By highlighting the tension between control and freedom in digital media, Chun prompts us to critically examine the ways in which hypertextual environments can both empower and constrain users. Her work encourages a nuanced understanding of the complexities of online interaction, acknowledging the influence of broader socio-technical systems on individual agency and autonomy  <cite>(Chun, 2006)</cite>.
                        </p>
                        <h4> <cite>Safiya Noble's</cite> Research on Algorithmic Bias:</h4>
                        <p> <cite>Safiya Noble</cite>, an Associate Professor at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), investigates the ways in which algorithmic systems lead to systemic inequalities. Her research focuses on the biases embedded within search engines and other digital platforms, which often reinforce harmful stereotypes and discriminatory practices.
                            <cite>Noble's </cite> work highlights the limitations of hypertext's democratizing potential by showing how algorithmic decision-making processes can reproduce and intensify existing social biases. For example, search engine algorithms may prioritize certain types of content while disregarding others, leading to unequal access to information and reinforcing dominant narratives that reflect societal power dynamics.
                            By exposing the ways in which algorithmic bias operates within hypertextual environments, Noble's research prompts critical reflection on the ethical implications of digital technologies. She encourages for taking action to address these ongoing inequalities in online spaces through interventions that promote fairness and inclusivity.
                            <cite>Moulthrop's </cite> insights into hypertextuality have known effects for digital literacy and education in the 21st century. By emphasizing the importance of critical navigation and evaluation of online information, his work informs strategies for directing the complexities of the digital landscape. For example, educators can draw upon Moulthrop's concepts to teach students how to critically assess the credibility of online sources, recognize algorithmic biases, and engage in informed digital citizenship practices.

                            <h3>Reflection on Interaction and the WWW</h3>
                            <p>
                                Drawing from the slides provided, the insights from various authors, we can consider how interaction on the WWW empowers users to actively engage with digital content, shape narratives, and co-create meaning within the fluid and interconnected landscape of the web.
                                For instance, <cite>Aaron Smuts'</cite> definition of interactivity as responsiveness, absence of complete control, and non-trivial effort resonates with the dynamics of user engagement on the WWW. However,  <cite>Lev Manovich's</cite> critique challenges the notion of interactivity, suggesting that the term has become overly broad and devoid of meaningful distinction.  <cite>Espen Aarseth's</cite> concept of ergodic literature reframes traditional notions of interactivity, emphasizing the non-trivial effort required to traverse hypertextual narratives. <cite>Gonzalo Frasca's</cite> expansion on Aarseth's concept highlights the transformative nature of interaction within hypertextual environments, where user actions shape narrative trajectories and facilitate emergent meaning-making processes. How might we reconcile these differing perspectives to develop a more nuanced understanding of interaction in digital environments?
                                I understand interaction on the World Wide Web (WWW) as a multi-layered concept that encompasses dynamic exchanges between users and digital environments, shaping the way we engage with online content and communities.
                                To illustrate the nature of interaction on the WWW, I considered platforms like Reddit, where users actively engage in discussions, upvote/downvote content, and contribute to the creation of diverse communities. Similarly, interactive storytelling projects like "Bandersnatch" on Netflix showcase how user choices can influence narrative outcomes, blurring the lines between traditional media consumption and active participation.
                                Exploring the intersectionality of interaction and social justice within online spaces reveals how factors like race, gender, and socioeconomic status shape users' experiences and access to digital resources, which I feel like was not covered in the reading by <cite>Moulthrop</cite>. Research by scholars like <cite>Sasha</cite> on "design justice" highlights the importance of centering marginalized voices in the design of digital platforms to address systemic inequities and power imbalances.
                                Looking ahead, emerging technologies such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and artificial intelligence (AI) are ready to reshape our understanding of interaction on the WWW. VR platforms like Oculus Quest offer immersive social experiences, while AI-driven chatbots and voice assistants enable more natural and intuitive forms of interaction. These developments underscore the need for ongoing dialogue and critical inquiry into the ethical and social implications of evolving digital technologies.
