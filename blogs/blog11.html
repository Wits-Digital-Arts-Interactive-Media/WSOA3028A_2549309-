            <h2 class="p-name"> Reflecting on Development from Code to Culture</h2>
      <h3> How CSS, HTML, and JavaScript Interact</h3>
      <p class="intro">
        When developing a website, I utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure that the structure, style, and functionality come together to create an engaging and responsive experience for users. 
      </p>
      <h3> How it all relates </h3>
      <P>
        In my web development projects, CSS serves as the styling language that brings life to the structural markup provided by HTML.
      </P>
      <P>
        I began by laying down the HTML structure, which includes defining elements like headers, navigation links, content sections, and footers. This markup forms the skeleton of the website. My focus here is on semantic HTML, which not only aids in accessibility but also aligns with the ethical coding practices by ensuring content is understandable both by browsers and assistive technologies. Once the HTML structure was in place, I used CSS to enhance these elements. This involves setting visual properties such as colors, fonts, margins, and more. In my approach, CSS is not just about visual appeal but also about ensuring that the styles promote inclusivity, such as using color schemes that are accessible to visually impaired users. I ensured that the CSS is responsive so that the website maintains its aesthetics across different devices. I often use CSS classes and IDs in HTML to apply specific styles. This method provides a clean separation of structure and styling, making maintenance and updates easier. 
      </P>
      <P>
        JavaScript plays a crucial role in dynamically modifying both the HTML elements and the CSS properties to enhance interactivity and user experience. In my projects, JavaScript is used to dynamically change styles based on user interactions. For example, I might highlight the current page in the navigation menu by changing its CSS properties when it's clicked. I need to work on ensuring JavaScript also responds to device-specific events, like resizing the window or changing the orientation of the device, adjusting CSS properties accordingly to ensure the layout remains consistent and functional. Beyond simple style changes, JavaScript enables more complex interactions and animations by manipulating CSS classes and transitions. This adds a layer of polish and professionalism to the user interface. 
      </P>
      <h3> Benefits of Responsive Design</h3>
      <P>
        My experience has consistently shown that responsive design significantly increases the accessibility of a website across various devices. This universality is critical as mobile usage continues to climb—Statista reports that mobile devices (excluding tablets) generated 54.4% of global website traffic in the first quarter of 2021. By designing responsively, I ensure that my websites are accessible and functional on any device, which increases user engagement and satisfaction.
        Google has made it clear that mobile friendliness is a ranking factor in its search algorithms. I know this because of the deep analysis I did on a well-known website which can be found under the Essay section. Responsive design is not just about user interface—it also aligns with these SEO best practices.
        Developing one responsive website rather than multiple versions for different devices reduces development and maintenance costs. This approach eliminates the need for additional coding and site management, which saves both time and resources. According to Forbes, companies that opt for a responsive design typically see a significant reduction in development costs and long-term digital spending.
        
      </P>
      <h3> Challenges of Responsive Design</h3>
      <P>
        One of the most significant challenges I've faced with responsive design is the complexity of the initial setup. Designing for multiple screens requires a deep understanding of CSS and HTML, as well as a thoughtful approach to content hierarchy.
        Ensuring that a website performs well on all potential devices and screen sizes can be daunting. This requires a comprehensive testing strategy that covers a wide range of devices from the latest smartphones to older desktop monitors. Tools like BrowserStack and responsive design checkers play a critical role here, but they also add to the project timeline and complexity.
        While responsive design allows for a website to be viewed on many devices, it can also constrain the creative aspects of design. Sometimes, what looks good on a desktop does not scale down well to a mobile screen. Balancing aesthetics with functionality becomes a juggling act. Finding creative solutions within these constraints is challenging and requires innovative thinking and design flexibility.

      <h3>How My Code Matters in Decolonialism: Building Ethical Coding Practices from the Start</h3>
      <P>As I launch my portfolio website, I recognize that this digital space is not just a showcase of my work but also a reflection of my values and ethics. With this power comes the responsibility to ensure my coding practices align with decolonial principles. Here’s how I plan to build ethical and inclusive coding practices from the very beginning.</P>
            <p>I will ensure my blogs and essays include diverse viewpoints, particularly from marginalized communities. This enriches my content and challenges dominant narratives.My writing will critically engage with historical and contemporary issues of colonialism, using this platform to highlight decolonial topics and open up others eyes to this area too.</p>
    <p>Something to consider as I continue developing. Over-reliance on Western frameworks and resources can lead to a limited perspective on what constitutes good design or user experience. This might unintentionally marginalize or exclude non-Western users. I should actively seek out resources, designs, and technologies developed in different cultural contexts. Engage with designers and developers from diverse backgrounds to understand the multiplicity of user needs and experiences.</p>
