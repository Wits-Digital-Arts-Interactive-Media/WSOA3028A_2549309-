   <p class="intro">
    Creating my first website was an exhilarating journey that transformed my initial vision into a polished digital space.  This reflection explores the evolution of my project, the strategic decisions made to balance creativity with functionality, and the invaluable lessons learned.   <p>
    <p>I&#39;m satisfied with how my final website turned out, though it evolved significantly from my initial
        vision. During my journey of learning CSS and exploring award-winning websites, I discovered
        the impressive possibilities of website design. Some of these features, which I initially wanted to
        include, had to be removed because I couldn&#39;t get them to work properly and be responsive as I
        wanted. For instance, I wanted to incorporate advanced parallax scrolling, where different elements
        move at varying speeds. This effect requires more JavaScript, which in turn demands more
        processing power and can increase load times, putting additional pressure on performance. As
        this is my first website, I decided to prioritize learning to do things right over being overly
        creative. By focusing on making the design responsive, ensuring faster load times, maintaining good
        performance speed, and adhering to good coding practices (such as using meta tags,
        microformatting, and semantic HTML), I aimed to build a solid foundation. This approach aligns
        with the principles I discussed in my blogs, particularly in the South African context, where
        mobile-first design is crucial due to the high mobile internet usage.</p>

        <h3>Coding practices</h3>

       <p>Reflecting on my coding practices for HTML and JavaScript, I feel confident that they were well-
        structured and efficient. However, my approach to CSS revealed significant areas for
        improvement, particularly in terms of scalability and reusability.</p>
    <p>Instead of creating reusable classes for common elements such as headings, containers, and
        text, I ended up writing separate styles for each page (e.g., essay, blog, about). This approach
        led to unnecessary repetition and clutter in my CSS files</p>
    <p>Because I didn’t use reusable classes, making changes to the design required adjusting the
        styles for each individual element across multiple pages. This process was time-consuming and
        prone to errors, making it difficult to maintain and scale the website effectively.
        Through this experience, I’ve learned the importance of scalable and reusable CSS practices.
        Adopting these strategies not only streamlines the development process but also enhances the
        maintainability and flexibility of the website. Moving forward, I will prioritize creating reusable
        classes, utilizing CSS variables, adopting a modular approach, and leveraging preprocessors to
        write cleaner, more efficient CSS</p>
    <p>Improving my CSS practices is essential for building a robust, maintainable, and scalable
        website. By focusing on reusability and scalability, I can ensure that my website remains flexible
        and easy to update, providing a better experience for users and a more efficient workflow for
        
        myself. This reflection has been an invaluable part of my learning journey, and I look forward to
        implementing these best practices in future projects.</p>
