                    Creating my first website was an exhilarating journey that transformed my initial vision into a polished digital space. This reflection explores the evolution of my project, the strategic decisions made to balance creativity with functionality, and the invaluable lessons learned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm satisfied with how my final website turned out, though it evolved significantly from my initial vision. During my journey of learning CSS and exploring award-winning websites, I discovered the impressive possibilities of website design. Some of these features, which I initially wanted to include, had to be removed because I couldn't get them to work properly and be responsive as I wanted. For instance, I wanted to incorporate advanced parallax scrolling, where different elements move at varying speeds. This effect requires more JavaScript, which in turn demands more processing power and can increase load times, putting additional pressure on performance. As this is my first website, I decided to prioritize learning to do things right over being overly creative. By focusing on making the design responsive, ensuring faster load times, maintaining good performance speed, and adhering to good coding practices (such as using meta tags, microformatting, and semantic HTML), I aimed to build a solid foundation. This approach aligns with the principles I discussed in my blogs, particularly in the South African context, where mobile-first design is crucial due to the high mobile internet usage.
                </p>

                <h3>Coding practices</h3>

                <p>Reflecting on my coding practices for HTML and JavaScript, I feel confident that they were well-structured and efficient. However, my approach to CSS revealed significant areas for improvement, particularly in terms of scalability and reusability.</p>
                <p>Instead of creating reusable classes for common elements such as headings, containers, and text, I ended up writing separate styles for each page (e.g., essay, blog, about). This approach led to unnecessary repetition and clutter in my CSS files.</p>
                <p>Because I didn’t use reusable classes, making changes to the design required adjusting the styles for each individual element across multiple pages. This process was time-consuming and prone to errors, making it difficult to maintain and scale the website effectively. Through this experience, I’ve learned the importance of scalable and reusable CSS practices. Adopting these strategies not only streamlines the development process but also enhances the maintainability and flexibility of the website. Moving forward, I will prioritize creating reusable classes, utilizing CSS variables, adopting a modular approach, and leveraging preprocessors to write cleaner, more efficient CSS.</p>
                <p>Improving my CSS practices is essential for building a robust, maintainable, and scalable website. By focusing on reusability and scalability, I can ensure that my website remains flexible and easy to update, providing a better experience for users and a more efficient workflow for myself. This reflection has been an invaluable part of my learning journey, and I look forward to implementing these best practices in future projects.</p>

                <h4>GitHub</h4>
                <p>My step for designing the website was setting up GitHub. The software I feared! At the beginning, navigating GitHub was challenging. The command-line interface was unfamiliar, and I worried about making errors that could break my site or lose my work. The concept of version control, while theoretically understood, seemed complex in practice. It was especially scary to push changes and view live pages, fearing that something might go wrong.</p>
                <p>Gradually, as I started using GitHub more frequently, the fear began to subside. Embracing GitHub has been a significant milestone in my development as a web developer. It has taught me the importance of version control, disciplined me to document my progress meticulously, and equipped me with skills that are highly valued in the tech industry.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, what once seemed like an enemy has become a trusted ally. GitHub is now a tool that I rely on for managing my projects efficiently and professionally. The initial fear has transformed into confidence, underscoring the fact that overcoming challenges is a crucial part of growth in any learning journey.</p>

                <h3>Overall Aesthetics</h3>
                <p>As I reflect on my portfolio website, I see that it looks very structured, minimalistic, and basic. I avoided adding any fancy, extra elements. While it might appear characterless, professional, and strict, it reflects a certain aspect of myself. It demonstrates that I am simple, professional, clean, focused, and directed, without distractions or unnecessary elements compromising usability.</p>
                <p>This minimalistic approach aligns with my overall design philosophy. By keeping the design clean and straightforward, I ensure that the user experience remains focused on the content without any distractions. Although the website might lack some creative flair, it serves its purpose well by being user-friendly and efficient. This decision reflects my commitment to creating practical, functional designs that prioritize usability over unnecessary embellishments.</p>
                <p>In developing my website, I extensively researched best practices in UI and UX design, drawing from a variety of academic sources and industry experts. For example, <cite>Don Norman's</cite> principles of design, particularly the importance of usability and user-centered design, significantly influenced my approach. <cite>Norman </cite> emphasizes that good design is centered around the needs and abilities of users, which aligns with my decision to prioritize a responsive, mobile-first design for my South African audience <cite>(Norman, 2013).</cite> Research from <cite> Jakob Nielsen</cite> also reinforced the importance of simplicity and ease of use, guiding my minimalist approach to ensure users can easily navigate and engage with the content <cite>(Nielsen, 1994)</cite>.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the concept of <cite>"Progressive Enhancement"</cite> played a crucial role in my design strategy. Progressive enhancement focuses on building a basic, functional version of the site that works for all users, and then adding advanced features for users with more capable devices and browsers. This ensures that my site remains accessible on low-bandwidth connections while still providing a rich experience for those with better internet access <cite>(Keith, 2010)</cite>.</p>
                <p>Given that many South Africans access the internet primarily through their smartphones, I adopted a mobile-first approach. This decision is supported by data from the <cite> International Telecommunication Union (ITU)</cite>, which highlights the high mobile internet usage in the region <cite>(ITU, 2021)</cite>. Designing with a mobile-first mindset ensured that my site performs well on smaller screens and touch devices, which is crucial for reaching a wider audience. However, I also ensured that the desktop experience remains rich and engaging, striking a balance between creativity and functionality.</p>
