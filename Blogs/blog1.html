                <h2 id="post-heading">Exploring the Roots of Internet and Web Technologies</h2>
            <p> 
                It's interesting to see how the development of the Internet led to an overall advancement in technology. Upon reading the article by <cite>Engelbart </cite> and <cite>English</cite>, I learned about the invention of other devices such as a mouse, and headset and now we have touchscreens. Even more so we can use voice recognition to give instruction! It is interesting to see how the computer and the internet have led to the development of so many technologies.

                <h3>Reflecting on the Evolution of the Internet:</h3> 
        
            <p> Exploring the history of the internet through readings and examining the first-ever published website was interesting. It's remarkable to witness the transformation from a simple text-based interface to the vibrant, multimedia-rich experiences we encounter today. The evolution of user interfaces, with the addition of colors, images, links, and interactive elements like buttons, has undoubtedly enhanced the user experience and accessibility of the web.  <cite>Vannevar Bush's</cite> visionary paper continues to resonate, advocating for human-centric design principles that mirror the associative trails of the human mind, ultimately shaping the way we navigate and comprehend information online <cite> (Bush, 1945)</cite>.

             <h3> Setting Up GitHub and Publishing to Pages: </h3> 
                
              <p>   Upon setting up my GitHub repository and publishing it to GitHub Pages, I was pleasantly surprised by the ease and speed of the process. With just a few clicks, I was able to share my projects with the world. This highlights the remarkable progress in web development accessibility. Contrast this with the technological barriers of the past, where specialized devices and technical expertise were prerequisites. This democratization of web development tools underscores the democratization of digital content creation and distribution.
                
                Reflecting on the history of the web, I couldn't help but appreciate the role that technologies like Flash played in shaping the internet as we know it today. Flash revolutionized web design by introducing interactive multimedia elements, paving the way for richer user experiences. However, its eventual decline serves as a reminder of the transient nature of technology and the importance of embracing open standards to ensure the longevity and accessibility of digital content.
                
                The reading by Turing was quite insightful and I found it relevant and linkable in the current context and evolution of the Internet. Turing concludes by expressing his belief that, within about fifty years, computers will be capable of playing the imitation game (now known as the Turing Test) well enough to fool an average interrogator. He dismisses objections to the possibility of machines thinking and suggests that, in the future, it will be common to speak of machines as capable of thought. As AI capabilities advance, the fine line between human and computer intelligence blurs.   The potential for machines to exhibit behavior akin to human thought processes raises intriguing questions about the future of technology and society.
                
                One notable argument Turing discusses is <cite> Lady Lovelace's</cite> objection, which suggests that machines can only perform tasks based on explicit instructions provided by humans. Turing counters this objection by proposing the concept of a "learning machine," which could potentially surpass its initial programming and exhibit behavior akin to human thought processes. That sounds scary, almost as if the computers could have a mind of their own.
                
                I mean since the introduction of AI, companies have been investing a lot in them, e.g.  Companies like Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft have developed models like GPT-3, BERT, and T5, which are used in various online services and platforms to improve communication and user experiences. Machine learning algorithms have achieved remarkable success in computer vision tasks, including image recognition, object detection, and facial recognition. In the Internet age, this technology powers applications such as image search, content moderation, augmented reality, and autonomous vehicles. Companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Tesla are investing heavily in computer vision research to enhance their products and services.
                
                In the reading of <cite>Bush</cite>, he emphasized the importance of human-centric design in computer systems. He supported interfaces that mirror the associative trails of the human mind, enabling individuals to navigate information more intuitively and efficiently. This concept resonates deeply with the evolution of the internet, where user experience has become paramount in shaping the digital landscape. Therefore, thanks to this concept, it has become easier for us to navigate online and publish/ view websites.

                <h3>Interesting things you have found about the history of the web </h3> 
                
               <p>The dark web is a mysterious and intriguing aspect of the internet's history. While the surface web, consisting of websites indexed by search engines like Google are accessible through standard browsers, is widely known, the dark web remains largely hidden from view <cite> (Greenberg, 2019)</cite>. One of the earliest platforms to facilitate anonymous communication was Usenet, a distributed discussion system established in the late 1970s. Usenet allowed users to exchange messages and files without revealing their identities, laying the groundwork for later developments in anonymous online communication <cite> (Soska & Christin, 2015) </cite>.
                
                The history of the dark web is a complex and multifaceted story that reflects the evolving nature of the internet and society's relationship with technology. While it remains a controversial and enigmatic space, the dark web continues to play a significant role in shaping the digital landscape, challenging traditional notions of privacy, freedom, and security online.
