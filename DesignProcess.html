                <h4>Reference material</h4>
                <p>The first step in my design process involves brainstorming ideas, researching, and conceptualizing the project.</p>
                
                <p>When looking for references I first looked at a lot of websites for inspiration so I can help design the wireframes for my website but as a continued to design my website, I realized that I needed to design my website to align with my target audience and the purpose of my website. Therefore, I had to revisit references of portfolio website that have similar goals as mine so I can see how they represent their content appropriately.</p>

                <li><a href="https://www.rafaelvarona.com/" target="_blank">Rafael Varona</a></li>
            
            </ul>

            <p>The main website I used for inspiration was the one by Rafael.</p>
            <p> I found her home page and the consistent navigation menu on each page a good way to allow users to intuitively explore different sections. A consistent navigation menu is key to a user-friendly experience because it helps visitors orient themselves no matter where they are on the site. It's great for keeping the design unified and makes sure users can always find their way to important sections without unnecessary clicks or confusion. Varona's use of a prominent homepage and a persistent navigation menu likely serves to engage visitors right from the start, providing a snapshot of her skills and offerings while ensuring they can easily search deeper into the content. This setup respects the users' time by streamlining their navigation experience and aligns with web design best practices for accessibility and user experience. Other websites I used as inspiration also used a similar navigation technique. </p>

        <h4>Style Guide</h4>
        <h5> Defining Visual Aesthetic</h5>
        <p> The aesthetic of the website aims to be modern, minimalist, and user-friendly. It seeks to create an engaging and interactive experience that showcases creativity through simplicity. The design focuses on showcasing interactive media and game design work, which means it should be visually appealing yet not overwhelming, allowing the work itself to stand out.</p>
        <p>This aesthetic complements the content by not overshadowing the showcased work. A minimalist design ensures that the portfolio pieces, blogs, and essays are the focal points. This approach also aligns with the usability principles, ensuring that the website is accessible and easy to navigate.</p>
        <h5>Color Scheme</h5>
        <P>A clean and modern aesthetic, leading to the selection of a neutral color palette with one or two accent colors for emphasis (e.g., a vibrant blue or green).
            </P><p>
            Neutral backgrounds  provide a clean canvas that makes content stand out, enhancing readability and user focus. The choice of a vibrant accent color is to draw attention to key interactive elements like calls to action, links, and buttons. This strategy using color psychology to guide user behavior while maintaining a professional and uncluttered appearance. The neutral backdrop focuses attention on the content, while the color accents guide the user to interactive elements. This approach also aligns with visual accessibility standards.
            </p>
        <p> View my colour palettes below:</p>

        <img src="Images/colourPalette2.jpg" alt="An image with circles of different colours (earthy tones, cool grey, light grey, and almost black) showing colour palette for website "width="400" height="300">
        <details>
            <summary>Alignment with goal</summary>
        <p>The mix of a subdued blue, a soft peach, a dark sea green, and a muted green suggests a fresh, current vibe that doesn't overpower the user. It's sophisticated and could be great for highlighting design work without competing with it. These colours can be used for interface elements to subtly direct attention and provide a sense of calm and balance.</p>
        <p>The neutral palette offers earthy tones, cool grey, light grey, and almost black, implying a grounded, classic look that's often associated with simplicity and elegance. This could be particularly effective in sections that are text-heavy or where I want users to focus on content rather than design, such as blog or essay pages.</p>
        <p>I need to remember that colour can carry different meanings and invoke various emotions, so I need to consider the psychological impact on the users. For instance, blue tones are often associated with trust and dependability, while greens can represent growth and calmness. Neutral tones tend to be versatile and can provide a strong foundation for various design elements to stand out, such as portfolio pieces or calls to action. </p>
        <p>As I refine my style guide, I will consider the legibility of text over these colours, ensuring there is sufficient contrast, particularly for those with visual impairments. Tools like the WebAIM (Web Accessibility In Mind) Contrast Checker can help me ensure that the text is readable against the chosen background colours. </p>

        <h5>Layout</h5>
        <p>A structured layout with a focus on simplicity and content prioritization, utilizing a combination of grid-based arrangements for sections and flexible containers that ensure responsiveness. </p>
        <p>A structured, grid-based layout allows for a clean organization of content, making it easier for users to navigate and find information quickly. Distinct sections for different content types, such as portfolio pieces, blog entries, and essays, each with its own layout nuance. This structured approach facilitates easy content consumption and allows users to engage with content in a manner that suits their interest, whether they are scanning quickly or diving deep into an essay. The use of flexible containers ensures that the website is accessible and visually appealing across a range of devices, improving the overall user experience by adapting content presentation to suit different screen sizes. </p>
        <h5> Font Choices</h5>
        <p>A combination of a clean, sans-serif font for headings and user interface elements, and a highly readable serif or sans-serif font for body text. </p>
        <p>The choice of a sans-serif font for headings and UI elements is driven by the need for clarity and modernity, ensuring that titles are legible, and interfaces look contemporary. For body text, a serif or easily readable sans-serif font enhances the reading experience, especially for longer texts, by improving legibility and reducing eye strain. </p>
        <h5> Interface Element Representations</h5>
        <p> Ensure users can easily identify them.Rounded corners for buttons to suggest approachability. Position these elements where they naturally fit into the user's exploration path, such as call-to-action buttons placed at the end of content sections.</p>
        <h5> Composition</h5>
        <p> Use visual hierarchy to guide the user's journey through website, employing size, color, and layout to emphasize important content. I Aim for a balance that supports user engagement without distraction, using thoughtful asymmetry to keep the design interesting. Ensure harmony by consistently applying my design choices across all pages.</p>
        <h5>Consistency and Navigation</h5>
        <p> Consistent navigation across all pages with a right-aligned menu. This promotes familiarity and ease of use, as users can predictably find the navigation from page to page. The alignment respects the Western reading pattern, from left to right, ending with actionable items.</p>
        <h5> Imagery and Visual Storytelling</h5>
        <p> Large, medium and small (depending on page), expressive images for portfolio and blog entries, also home page, with captions when necessary.</p>
        <p> The images provide a visual break from text and help to tell a story, showcasing my work and thoughts effectively. It also aligns with best practices for portfolio sites where visual work needs to be front and center.</p>
